# Twitter_loginStudy
A UI/CSS study from Twitter login page.

Here, I developed the Login Page from Twitter.com, as a resource to study how designers and front-end developers think when they're making a page like that.

I tried to make the page the most responsive that I can do, without using an external CSS file. (That means, that on mobile devices, the page doesn't adapt itself to the screen...)

## Technologies used:
- HTML;
- CSS (Here I used pure CSS and a bit of Bootstrap);
- JavaScript;
